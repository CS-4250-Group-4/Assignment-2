<p>The only way to be eligible to take the RD exam is to successfully be accepted into and complete a Dietetic Internship (DI), which is also called a Supervised Practice.</p>
<p>The dietetic internship (DI) is a post-baccalaureate supervised practice program. An ACEND accredited DI is typically a full-time and non-paid commitment for the duration of six to twelve months. Upon completion of a DI, students are eligible to take the National Registration Examination for Dietitians administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration.</p>
<p><em>The selection process for DI applicants is very competitive</em>. Students should plan ahead in order to build an effective career portfolio during their undergraduate experience. To meet minimum eligibility requirements for a DI, individuals must complete the ACEND accredited DPD coursework and earn their bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>In addition, strong applicants usually have a grade point average at or above 3.2; paid and volunteer work experiences in dietetics; demonstrated effective leadership, professional, and communication skills; shown commitment to community service and the practice of dietetics; and received strong recommendations from faculty and employers. The student must have met the minimum requirements and obtained a Verification Statement by the time the DI begins.</p>
<p>There are two application times each year. For programs beginning in January-February, applications are to be completed in September. For programs beginning in July-September, applications will be completed in February. Applying to programs that compliment your qualifications and skills will increase your chances of being accepted to a DI. DPD students are encouraged to apply to a DI anywhere in the nation. They are advised to find a DI that fits their financial, academic and geographic needs.</p>
<p>To better assist students, the DPD program at Cal Poly Pomona provides information workshops twice a year to discuss the DI application and decision-making processes. The department also offers a one-unit course every fall (NTR 4310 &#8211; Dietetic Internship Exploration) to provide students with the information needed to successfully pursue a DI. Students are also strongly encouraged to meet individually with the DPD program director and faculty to help them assess their potential to obtain a DI.</p>

<h3>Career Opportunities</h3>
<p>The registered dietitian (RD) is a nationally recognized health professional that specializes in the promotion and integration of proper nutrition practices. With training in the areas of human nutrition, food science, biology, chemistry, social sciences, management, and education, the RD is capable of incorporating this information into practical working solutions for healthy living. The RD works with individuals and groups from diverse cultures with varying concerns to help them make positive lifestyle changes. There are many employment opportunities in food and nutrition for the registered dietitian, each differing by target population, level of expertise, and primary location. Some career options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clinical Dietetics</strong>: Clinical dietitians utilize medical nutrition therapy to accurately assess nutritional needs and determine nutritional diagnoses. They create both individualized and group nutritional programs, which include counseling and outcome evaluation, based on the health needs of patients or residents. Clinical dietitians may work in hospitals, nursing homes or outpatient settings, and with other healthcare professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Community Nutrition</strong>: A community dietitian applies human nutrition knowledge to help people in the community meet their food and nutrition needs. These dietitians plan, organize and implement aspects of nutrition policies and programs designed to prevent disease and improve health at the community level. Community dietitians work to promote public health in clinics, government, and non-profit agencies with diverse groups of individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Food Service Management</strong>: Dietitians working on food service management plan, implement, and evaluate meal programs and food service systems. They may be responsible for budgeting and buying food, as well as for carrying out other business-related tasks such as employee training, staff management, and developing policies and standards within the workplace. They may work in healthcare facilities, schools, senior centers, hotels or restaurants.</li>
<li><strong>Business and Industry</strong>: Dietitians may be employed to work in a variety of settings, including sales, marketing, public relations, research and development, and production quality control. Dietitians may also work with food and pharmaceutical companies, marketing associations and food service providers to develop, promote and market food and nutritional products.</li>
<li><strong>Private Practice/ Consultation</strong>: Dietitians working in private practice or on a consultant basis are generally self-employed under their own private consulting business; however, previous experience in dietetic practice is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Research dietitians are involved with development, implementation, and assessment of nutrition-related research projects. These dietitians may work in a clinical research center in a hospital, private company, or academic center. Advanced degrees are usually required for research and university-based jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrition Jobs for Those without RD Certification</strong>: Obtaining the RD certification is required for many jobs within the fields of health and nutrition. However, there are career opportunities for those who receive their bachelor's degree and do not complete the requirements for becoming an RD. These include food service supervisor, community nutritionist for organizations like WIC, diet clerk or dietetic technician, registered, and other various positions within food and health businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in dietetics offers a rewarding career with a promising future. Appreciation for the profession is growing, translating into a greater need for and utilization of nutrition experts in health promotion practices throughout the country. As public interest continues to move in the direction of improving nutrition and health, emerging employment opportunities are ideal for the knowledge, training and versatility of the registered dietitian.
